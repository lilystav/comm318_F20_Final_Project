## Data analysis notebooks for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project


#### `Increased_Popularity` 

* This notebook shows goods and services that have increased in popularity since the pandemic started. I used google trends data to represent this. I made graphs to represent the popularity, and wrote comments at the bottom of the graphs so the reader can better understand the trends to keep an eye out for. 

#### `Decreased_Popularity`

* This notebook shows goods and services that have decreased in popularity since the pandemic started. I used google trends data to represent this. I made graphs to represent the popularity, and wrote comments at the bottom of the graphs so the reader can better understand the trends to keep an eye out for. 

#### `Comparisons`

* This notebook compares goods and services that are doing well since Covid, and ones that are becoming less popular. I used google trends data for this and have graphs to represent this. I used services that are similar to each other (such as movie theaters and online streaming services) so I can accuratly make conclusions about these fields. I wrote conclusions at the end of the graphs so the reader knows the important information extracted from the data. 

#### `Stock_Market_Trends`

* This notebook looks at stock prices for the past year. I analyze this data of certain companies and make conclusions about what companies are doing well since covid and which ones are not. This gives a good representation of how a company is doing which is helpful in understanding consumer prefrences. I got this data from Yahoo Finance and put it into both bar and line graphs so it is easy to interpret. Additionally, I put observations at the end of each data set so the reader can easily understand what this means for consumer prefrences and how this is a result of the pandemic.
