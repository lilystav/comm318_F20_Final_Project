## Presentation of your data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

Main Research Question: How have consumer preferences changed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic?

This topic involved Google Trends and Yahoo Finance data to come up with conclusions on consumer trends and preferences. I combined all of this data to come up with four major shifts of consumer behavior which I elaborate on in the data story presentation. 

My target audience is anyone who wants to learn or is interested in consumerism and how it might change as a result of Covid-19. I wanted to present the data in a way that everyone would understand so I decided to do it in the form of a video, using Prezi. I voiced over the Prezi and gave my analysis on the data and my findings. I put the movie into another notebook in this folder, and I put the Prezi in a PDF form and also the link below. I reccomend using the link so you can go through the presentation with the animations and it makes it flow better.
